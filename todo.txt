In a separate file so rjbs can ignore/delete if he wishes. But if this were my
module, this is what I would do next. Or he can punt back to me and I'll do it :)

- alter names of new packages:
  MooseX::SetOnce::Attribute -> MooseX::SetOnce::Meta::Trait::Attribute
  MooseX::SetOnce::Accessor  -> MooseX::SetOnce::Meta::Trait::Accessor
- add Test::NoWarnings to unit tests
- switch Try::Tiny try{} to Test::Exception lives_ok {}
- convert to using Module::Install (this is probably already done, but is just
  not in the repository - missing Makefile.PL, MANIFEST, META.yml, MANIFEST.SKIP etc)
- remove use lib 'lib'; from unit tests ('make test' takes care of this)
- add author tests - pod, eol, notabs etc
- more detailed docs?
